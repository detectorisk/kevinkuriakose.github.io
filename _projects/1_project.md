A client had given me footfall data for a period they ran media in the period 2022-2023. They wanted to understand how media effects footfall, the KPI that they have identified that drives their business forward.

I have all of my analysis in an R mardown file. Through this work, I have tried to study some general trends, best and worst performing stores, as well tried to isolate some of the effects of different digital media campaigns in driving consumers to the client's physical stores. I have also spatially mapped the stores across UK to see the spread and visibility, as well as to see if there are any regional level differences.

Some of the R libraries used in this analytical work are: Ggplot, Dplyr, Tidyverse, Maps, Viridis, Ggrepel.

Rather than looking at absolute footfall numbers, since that is a product of the demographic population of the neighbhourhood the stores are in, the size of the store, and other external factors, there is a need to see the change in average weekly footfall to identify stores attracting most increases in footfall. As for Ad Spend, they were discrete investments, thus causal effects are conjectural, and based on hypothesis testing.
